          <p>
            Hi there, I'm Zach. I'm a full-stack developer with a healthy
            passion for programming (and a special love for Javascript). I have
            10+ years of programming experience, and am currently living in the
            Columbus, Ohio area.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started programming at age 13, nearly 20 years ago, with a small
            Pokemon fansite hosted on Yahoo Geocities. Since then, I studied
            Computer Science at Brigham Young University (2011-13) My
            professional work has covered many key roles in web development:
            implementing design system components, supporting JS libraries,
            debugging client solutions, maintaining documentation and creating
            and deploying web app tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm also an avid Guild Wars 2 player, and have led community
            projects to collect millions of data points, and provide insight
            into the game's economy with statistics. I also develop web
            applications and tools to optimize strategies based on that data
            analysis.

            Veeva CRM Support Engineer <br />
            < Node.js / MongoDB / Vue / jQuery / Angular / Apex > <br />
            <br />
            link:
            <a href="https://developer.veevacrm.com/">
              API reference for Veeva CRM's JS Libraries
            </a>
          </h4>
          <p>
            In this role, I designed and developed web apps to automate
            diagnostics for Salesforce.com configuration, called Veeva
            Permissions Diagnostics(VPD). VPD increased efficiency of checking
            user permissions by 50-100 times in an average case of 19 permission
            sets, and up to 500x faster in worst cases when the user had over
            100 permissionsets. The chrome extension linked above was created as
            the entry point to VPD, and contains some screenshots of some of
            these tools.
            <!-- The basis for several of the tools is summarizing Salesforce permission sets, which are additively granted to users, but can only be viewed separately/individually in the Salesforce UI.  
                These tools combined and cached the metadata for these settings in a single-page application for significantly faster review.  In average cases the tool summarized 19 permsets per use, and sometimes more than 100 permsets. -->
            VPD saw use by 150+ internal employees across multiple teams. Since
            Oct 2019 when we launched, VPD tools have been used nearly 20,000
            times. As of July 2021, VPD saw over 50 uses per day during the
            workweek.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was also responsible for debugging custom HTML/JS views created
            for the CRM platform utilizing
            <a href="https://developer.veevacrm.com/">Veeva's JS libraries</a>,
            many of which used js frameworks like React and Angular. I also
            occasionally debuged Apex code, which is very similar to Java,
            proprietary to Salesforce.com.
          </p>

          <p>
            In these roles I contributed to web components both for design
            systems and their implementations in end products. This involved
            unit testing, ADA testing, and multiple frameworks as teams were
            transitioning to more modern technology. I collaborated with team
            leads consuming our components to steer features to meet needs
            efficiently and effectively.

            analyze data on random drop chances in the game, and hosts this data
            for reporting and exporting.
